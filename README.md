# Dynamic-Form-Builder
This project is a dynamic form builder built with Angular and Angular Material. The application supports two types of users: Admin and User. An Admin can log in and create custom forms by adding different types of fields such as text inputs, text areas, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date pickers. Each field can be configured with labels, required options, and selectable values, and the builder provides a live preview while editing. Once saved, the form template becomes available to Users, who can log in and view the form in a clean and interactive interface. Users can then fill in the form fields as per the template defined by the Admin. The project includes a simple role-based login system, where Admins are redirected to the Form Builder and Users are redirected to the Template Viewer. With its responsive UI powered by Angular Material, this application provides an easy way to build, preview, and use dynamic forms without modifying any code.
